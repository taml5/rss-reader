# rss-reader
A simple RSS Feed web application to collate RSS data and display them.

You can start tracking channels, remove tracked channels, change the number of item displayed per channel, or refresh the page for new items. The backend is currently not deployed, so nothing will show in the feed area.

## TODO
- [ ] Finish readme
- [ ] Deploy backend
  - [ ] Change database implementation from SQLite
  - [ ] Deploy onto AWS Lambda
